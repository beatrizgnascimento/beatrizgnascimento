## Data Analyst & Business Intelligence

- Turning messy data into sharp insights → one query at a time.  
- I go beyond the dashboard: behavior, metrics, patterns → if it moves, I’ll analyze it.  
- SQL, Python & Amplitude → from raw data to narratives that make decisions easier (and smarter).

Based in Brazil • Fluent in numbers, charts, and human curiosity.
